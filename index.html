    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>I am interested in supporting research programmes develop, evaluate, and disseminate online interventions for youth with anxiety and/or mood disorders. More specifically, I hope to assist projects compare the efficacy of second-wave and third-wave techniques, and whether these techniques work best alone, blended, and for whom and under which philosophical orientation. In addition of pursuing this interest within the sphere of the digital landscape, during graduate school I would like to bridge advances in clinical science and technology in order to realize the potential of ecological momentary assessment, idiographic clinical profiles, optimized evidence-based and just-in-time interventions, and cognitive control training.<br/></br/> 
    On this website, you can find some of the web-based applications, PsychoPy and PsychoJS experimental replications, and resources I've created. Aligned with Open Science principles, the source codes have been made available.<br/><br/><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">More about me

<div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
  <div class="card card-body" style="border: none; background-color: #f5f5f5;">
    <p>I was initially drawn to study mental health from observations of cultural differences in the expressions of emotion, coping styles, and states of thriving. When the inequities in mental health services and delivery for marginalized and underserved populations became apparent, not to mention unfavourable implicit theories affecting these vulnerable populations, I was inspired to utilize my interest and background in technology and psychology to help develop a solution.<br/></br/>
    
      I am interested in assisting research programmes whose focus is online, evidence-based idiographic interventions, which retains my interest in cultural consideration for treatment while serving a greater number of people.<br/><br/>
    Currently, I am particular to comparing brief, online second-wave and third-wave techniques for youth with anxiety/mood disorders to examine their effectiveness and for which subset population/symptom profile they work best for. I am keen on evaluating techniques that are both clean and blended (e.g., mindfulness-alone or mindfulness+cognitive disputation). I am also interested in examining "what theoretical orientation do techniques work best in?". For example, would mindfulness work best as a process to modulate our context-dependent responses or as an attentional technique to focus and/or recall rational evidence for disputation? If both, how could this be reconciled?
        
        <br/><br/>
    Moreover, I am interested in emerging ways of thinking about psychopathology such as network analysis, process-based therapy, predictive processing, and evolution and contextual behavioural science. My understanding of these areas is nascent, and I am excited to learn more and see how I could possibly explore these ideas in graduate school. It would also be interesting to assist in translating cognitive science research to update cognitive-bias modification paradigms.<br /><br />
    
    Outside of research, I enjoy swimming, weightlifting (225BP - 2/11/2020), playing the piano, programming, and creative writing.

    <p>I created this micro intervention to explore what visual and auditory effects I could achieve through programming.<br/></br/>I intend to continue developing these online interventions in two branching directions: 1) Multi-sensory, multi-track interventions (e.g., relaxing visuals, sounds, soothing prompts/narration), and 2) Precision psychotherapeutic techniques.<br/></br/>By precision I mean offering interventions true to their psychometric definition. For example, many online "Mindfulness meditations" often overlap with self-compassion, defusion, and other discrete concepts. Although blended techniques are not inherently negative, I am interested, from a research perspective, in the precise creation of psychotherapeutic techniques.

        <b>Risk Assessment (Step 1)</b><br/>
        Visitors complete a 4-criteria suicide risk assessment for ideation, plan, means, and timeframe. These criterions are currently used by Crisis Text Line and Kids Help Phone. Those that meet all four (i.e., high-risk visitors) are immediately streamlined to the phone numbers of crisis services to get support and guided to practice a breathing exercise prompts while they connect. Low-risk visitors continue onto screening for psychological symptoms.
        
        <br/><br/><b>Screening (Step 2)</b><br/>
        I combined the DSM–5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure with the SCOFF questionnaire to screen for potential symptoms of anxiety, depression, problematic substance use, and disordered eating.
        
        <br/><br/><b>Personalized information (Step 3)</b></br>
    Visitors not at imminent risk receive a personalized mental health intervention and resources. Supportive words, a portrait of a peer, and a vignette are customized based on gender and ethnicity. Calming Techniques reflect distress tolerance exercises from DBT. The psychoeducation module shows only relevant information based on potential symptoms meeting the cut-off scores from the preceeding screening section. There are also resources for therapeutic programs, crisis services, and safety planning.<br/><br/>Vignettes deserve a special mention here. What a very interesting experience writing custom vignettes based on letters and videos from the respective demographics discussing mental illness (during background research). It would be interesting to examine methodological approaches to developing effective vignettes. For example, 1) Should one use humanistic and solution-focused principles right away? Then have the target demographic judge whether the constructed message was helpful? 2) Should we ask a target demographic to directly tell us what <i>they</i> want to hear and find helpful? 3) Should we tap into the wisdom of an older population of the target demographic to retrospectively reflect on what message (in both form and content) would have been most helpful when they were young?<br/><br/>Another interesting thought is the tricky balance in selecting vignette portraits. For example, "Asian" is a heterogeneous category, and recent immigrants (or displaced persons, refugees, etc.) may not find how a second- or third-generation immigrant relatable based on looks, or content/form of the peer message. Another consideration is that some visitors would prefer to match with their "virtual peer" in terms of cultural background instead of gender and ethnicity. Finally, while there's clear value in integrating the nomothetic literature (e.g., caucasian female adolescents may benefit most from eating disorder content), finding the balance between effectively targeting common problems for a target demographic and inadvertently reinforcing a stereotype seems like something that needs further exploration (hint: nomothetic meets idiographic)!

<p>Nonwithstanding the concerns of psychometric properties and valid clinical inferences of the following basic science paradigms, I used <b>PsychoPy</b> and <b>PsychoJS</b> to recreate some classical computerized cognitive experiments. These were great exercises to familiarize myself with experiment-creation software and the nuances and parameters of these classics. I hope you enjoy trying these online replications as much as I did in their creation.

      <p>I recreated the EST based on Ben-Haim et al. (2016). There are two conditions (mixed vs. blocked--neutral, negative): both include a training block (25 trials) and four experimental blocks (20 trials each).<br/></br/>I learned a lot more than I expected such as trial size requirements, counter-balancing (which is recommended <i>against</i> in the Stroop in certain circumstances such as carryover effects occuring when a negative block precedes a neutral block), and inter-trial intervals.<br/><br/>
        My favorite lesson would have to be the procedure in selecting lexical stimuli (e.g., HAL frequency, orthographic neighbourhoods, valence, arousal, domain vs. idiographic selection). Although my particular recreation had a much less methodologically rigorous stimuli selection process, I am glad I am aware of these parameters for future interventions that utilize personally-relevant stimuli.

    <p class="card-text">The Dot Probe Task (DPT) is one form of attention-bias modification (ABM). This version uses lexical stimuli for training and visual stimuli (i.e., visual dot probe task) for the experimental block, and measures RT by keyboard press. The purpose of this program is to train attention towards neutral as opposed to negative stimuli (as opposed to some ABMs developing attention to positivity).<br/><br/><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#cbma" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cbma">Read about the process and lessons

    <p>I adapted an ABM based on Amir et al. (2009). There are two conditions (active vs. control): both include a training block (16 trials of lexical stimuli) and one experimental block (20 trials). The experimental blocks had trials with 80% neutral-negative and 20% neutral-neutral stimulus. The active condition replaced all neutral images with the dot probe, whereas the control replaced only 50% of the 80% neutral-negative segment of the experimental block.<br/><br/>
        
        This was an interesting paradigm to learn about! Although the standard for duration of fixation cross and stimuli presentation is "500ms", seemingly minute variabilities in this parameter appear to capture different processes (e.g., normal populations with greater attention than anxious populations at 100ms but not 500ms may be an indicator of ability to disengage). Despite the comedic stimuli I chose for this recreation, it was overall a great exercise to familiarize myself with counter-balancing procedures (e.g., image position, probe position).<br/><br/>
        On the implicit cognition front, I am interested in many indices (e.g., allocation, disengagement) and what recent basic research findings can improve current cognitive-bias modification paradigms. This was an exciting first step as I work towards learning more about and recreating other ABM, CBM-I, and cogntive control training programs.<BR/><BR/><B>Primary study guiding the recreation:

    <p class="card-text">The Face Stimuli Standardizer program is a precision time-saver that standardizes the position and size of face stimuli. The picture below illustrates what exactly that means (<i>click picture to expand</i>):

    <p>Researchers developing face stimuli databases run into inevitable imprecision due to photography procedures (e.g., camera position, zoom, and head position). This program aims to correct this according to parameters such as size and position, while reserving ratios and preventing distortions (i.e., no stretchy face).<br/><br/>
        
        
        This solution is possible through a <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python/">facial detection algorithim</a>. While a team could choose to "standardize" faces through a manual procedure (e.g., onion skin and resizing) in an image editing software, simple changes would require recreation of entire stimuli sets--not only laborious, but increases the margin of error. Things can get overwhelming when one considers how many stimuli is created in gender * race * [enter other social psychological parameter like attractiveness or similarity], not to mention the intra-individual factors such as emotion and emotional intensity!<br/><br/>
        Thus, this program was born from the need to reduce noise in stimuli presentation. It was programmed in Python3 and is available for public use. Instructions are included in the .py script.
